## Introduction  
pyAp is a python package for calculating magmatic volatile, trace element concentrations, and oxygen fugacity using mineral apatite.  More modules will be added in the future.

It includes multiple apatite-based models developed by W. Li and co-authors, including: 

* ApThermo: a thermodynamic model for calculating melt H<sub>2</sub>O (and CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations (Li & Costa, 2020, 2023, GCA; see citations below).

  - Inputs:  Apatite F, Cl and H<sub>2</sub>O (if available) concentrations; Temperature and melt Cl and/or F concentrations (for calculating melt water).
  
  - Outputs: Apatite stoichiometry (atom per fomula unit); Exchange coefficients for OH-Cl and/or OH-F; H<sub>2</sub>O concentrations in the melt.
* ApREE: a lattice strain-thermodynamic model for calculating melt trace element (including REE) concentrations and oxygen fugacity (*fO<sub>2</sub>*) (Li et al., 2023, CMP).

  - Inputs:  Trace element concentrations in apatite and melt (be it melt inclusions/groundmass/whole rock).
  
  - Outputs: Partition coefficients of unmeasured trace elements; oxygen fugacity of the melt (if Eu was measured).
