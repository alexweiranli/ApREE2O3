pyAp
======
pyAp is a python package for calculating magmatic volatile, trace element concentrations, and oxygen fugacity using mineral apatite.

It includes multiple apatite-based models developed by W. Li and co-authors, including:

    ApThermo: a thermodynamic model for calculating melt H2O (and CO2) concentrations (following Li & Costa, 2020, GCA)
    ApREE2O3: a lattice strain-thermodynamic model for calculating melt trace element (including REE) concentrations and oxygen fugacity (fO2) (following Li et al, in review)

More modules will be added in the future (ApTimer - Li et al. 2020 EPSL; ApZone - Li et al. in prep).
